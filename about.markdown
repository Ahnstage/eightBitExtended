![Michael Ahn, 2025](/assets/images/aboutMePhoto.jpg)

From a very young age, I was told, "You ask very good questions." As a child, this felt really validating and I learned a lot about the world. 

As I got older, I continued to ask inquisitive questions but the tone and response shifted. It went from "you ask good questions" to "you're being really annoying." This shift was a formative experience for me: it's when people stopped spoon-feeding me satisfactory answers to the harder problems of life. 

It also hurt my feelings.

I created this website for two reasons:
1. to practice writing and static web development skills, and 
2. to explore some of the more difficult questions with unsatisfactory answers.

While I am still curious about many things, the general focus of this blog will be about (but not limited to) photography, martial arts, and the development of the creative process.
