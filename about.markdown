![Michael Ahn, 2025](/assets/images/aboutMePhoto.jpg)

From a very young age, I was told, "You ask very good questions." As a child, this felt really validating and I learned a lot about the world. 

As I got older, I continued to ask inquisitive questions but the tone and response shifted. It went from "you ask good questions" to "you're being really annoying." This shift was a formative experience for me: it's when people stopped spoon-feeding me satisfactory answers to the harder problems of life. 

It also hurt my feelings.

I created this website for three reasons:
1. to practice writing,
2. to practice static web development, and 
3. to explore the difficult questions where I got unsatisfactory answers.

The scope of my curiousity is vast, however the general focus of this blog will be about (but not limited to) photography, martial arts, and the development of the creative process.
