I was caught in a guillotine choke at the 2017 IBJJF No Gi World Championships. I remember thinking how routine it would be to get out of this choke as I had done in practice so many times before. I would defend, wait for my opponent to tire, and begin my attack. 

Never have I been so wrong, so fast. 

As I initiated my defence, I realized my opponent was 3 steps ahead of me. He had specific grip that shut my defence on arrival and I tapped out 4 seconds later.  Once he released his grip, I realized that my focus on physical conditioning was misplaced and that I allowed my opponent to dictate the pace. He was thinking faster than me the entire match, and was skilled enough to follow through.

In short, I wasn't outgunned. I was outplayed. 

When I stare at a blank page, camera, or empty timeline, the feeling of that guillotine re-merges. Instead of submitting, I'd like to face this sore spot and provide a public exhibit on how I handle the ever tightening grip of writing, photography, and editing.
