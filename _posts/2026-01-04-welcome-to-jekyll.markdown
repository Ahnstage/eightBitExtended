I've been desperate to make a self hosted blog for my entire 20s. I've given up on this and have opted for the path of least resistance.

The purpose of this blog is to consolidate some of my formal thoughts and be used as a creative outlet. 

As much as I would like to take credit for building this site from scratch, this wouldn't been possible without the help of Google Gemini.
