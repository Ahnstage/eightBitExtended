Weaponized cardio is an under appreciated speciality across combat sports as it's difficult to identify, not only to the spectator, but to your opponent as well. By the time your opponent catches on that you're a cardio specialist, it's likely they're in deep waters and on the receiving end of an onslaught of half-powered strikes.

[Diego De Jesus](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/209785-diego-dejesus) is fighter that exemplifies weaponized cardio. Bringing a technical judo and wrestling background into a Brazilian jiujitsu context, dumping larger, veteran grapplers on their backs is a routine sight for the gritty ace. Under pressure, Diego's posture and response is never tense, but elastic. His body momentarily gives under the weight of a heavy front headlock, but bounces back into form, taking his time to rebuild a base inevitably escaping to more dominant positions. At no point in this process does his face give any sense of panic or effort. It does not matter if you are stronger, faster, or more explosive than Diego - he finds a way out, and looks fresh doing it.  

Maintaining composure in mixed martial arts is a dangerous trait as it allows a fighter to make better decisions and dictate the pace of a fight. It's not always pretty, but that's fine. It's only when you're midway through the second round, your heart is redlining at 195 beats per minute, and you're gasping for air in a bid to oxygenate your cramping muscles, you rationalize your worst fears: 

"It's okay to quit."

Diego's amateur career demonstrates that consistent high volume output can overload technicians and defuse explosive strikers. It's a physical manifestation of the boiling frog - you feel fine at the beginning of the fight, but by the time you realize you're being cooked alive, it's too late. Victory slipped out of your hands once you started to push through your punches. 

Stepping into the cage requires an exhaustive list of preparation: scheduling sparring sessions, cooking your monotonous food prep, draining yourself for the weight cut - the list goes on. Beyond the physical transformation, mental rehearsal can aid you in stomaching the idea that you might sustain life altering physical damage. Regardless of how much you prepare, one of the scariest scenarios you can find yourself in is coming to terms, mid fight, that it was all for nothing.

It's early round two. You can see the strikes coming and you know how to respond - but you can't. Your body is shutting down and any attempt at throwing back results in you receiving three in kind. This is the moment you convince yourself that failure is readily available option, and one you're ready to take.

## *Post-Mortem*

*At the time of recording, I didn't think this video was going to go anywhere. It ended up being on of the better performing videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/begrapple" target="_blank">Be Grapple</a>.*

*I think one of the other reasons the video aged well is because Diego's notorious gas tank is on full display early in his career. You frequently see fighters as a "finished product". It's rare to see martial artists when they're raw and unrefined at the beginning of their career. There's a lot of insight to be gained in observing how a fledgling martial artist nurtures their latent abilities.*
